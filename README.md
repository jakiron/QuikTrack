# QuikTrack
What does it do? QuikTrack is a novel approach to keeping track of the items in your checklist. Be it documents needed for a presentation, or items for a road trip with your friends, or checklist for a potluck at your workplace, QuikTrack has got you covered. Itâ€™s powered by NFC (Near Field Communication) tags. The concept, basically, requires you to tag the item that you want tracked, and create an entry for the same in the mobile application. Then, if required, the app also gives you the flexibility to group the tracked items. When you want the checklist verified, you just have to scan the bag containing the items with your phone and QuikTrack will take care of the rest for you. 
Who is it for? QuikTrack is a general purpose application suitable for users, who depend on checklists to assist with their regular activities.
What is the differentiation from the competition? QuikTrack offers the following novelties: Tracking of physical items Faster verification of checklists Saves time, which is expensive than money. Powered by NFC Easy to use Supports tracking of multiple items at the same time Grouping of tracked items
